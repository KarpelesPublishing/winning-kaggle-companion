# Multi-Target Learning

Start from the reader's actual request and project. Explain the method when asked to learn it; inspect and edit their pipeline when asked to implement it. Read [the companion method](references/method.md) and consult [the conditional lesson records](references/lessons.json) for this chapter. The full chapter text is available in the book, not in this public bundle. The activity is one illustration, not complete chapter coverage. Select a lesson by its conditions, not its value grade alone.

Inspect which targets exist for each row and when each becomes available; mask genuinely missing labels instead of treating them as zeros. Establish a primary-only model and record per-target losses and held-out primary performance. Add a related auxiliary with an explicit loss weight, then measure gradient direction and magnitude on the same shared parameters without contaminating optimizer gradients. Verify any named weighting algorithm against its actual definition. Compare partial sharing or reduced auxiliary weight when conflict appears. Reject an auxiliary if primary performance falls reproducibly or if inference-time updates require targets not provided by the competition.

Use the project's metric direction, class order, prediction-time feature availability and validation population. Keep every target-derived operation inside the relevant training boundary. Compare with the incumbent using identical held-out rows. Run a small, bounded test, then record the hypothesis, changed files, seed, data and fold identity, scores and limitations. A training score does not establish an improvement. Treat constructed examples and reported competition results separately.

For additional fitting stages, consult [technical corrections](references/errata.md). Use the existing local runtime and reader-authorized budget. Submission, paid compute and external publication require a request for those actions. Do not claim an execution that did not occur.

## Apply and close the decision

For a relevant lesson, retain its trigger, action, comparison, limits and source. Translate the action into the current project only after checking required inputs and prediction/label timing. Trace upstream fitted stages as well as the final estimator. Preserve an incumbent; measure paired eligible predictions, complete runtime/memory and affected subgroups. Record keep, reject or defer, with actual artifacts and source/lesson IDs. A source reporting no ablation does not support an invented gain. If a local result motivates new book guidance, record it as a proposed adaptation for editorial review; do not silently change the canonical source.
